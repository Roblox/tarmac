# Tarmac Changelog

## Unreleased Changes
* **Breaking**: Codegen is no longer configurable. The correct codegen style is now chosen based on the kind of input. ([#28](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/tarmac/pull/28))
* Removed (unimplemented) `content-folder` target and added `none` target.
	* This target always fails to upload, and is useful to verify that all assets have been uploaded as part of a CI job.
* Added `asset-cache-path` config option. If specified, Tarmac will download managed assets from Roblox.com to populate the given directory with.
* Added `upload-to-group-id` config option to require that all uploaded assets are uploaded to the given group.

## 0.4.0 (2020-03-04)
* Tarmac now "alpha-bleeds" packed image spritesheets to prevent artifacts from appearing when resized in Roblox.
* Reworked Tarmac's codegen strategy. ([#22](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/tarmac/pull/22)
	* Inputs can now specify `codegen-path` and `base-path` to group together modules.
	* This helps reduce diff noise drastically.

## 0.3.1 (2020-02-04)
* Fixed `tarmac sync` sometimes re-uploading more images than it should. ([#19](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/tarmac/pull/19))
* Updated `tarmac-manifest.toml` to require hashes. This might cause errors when upgrading to 0.3.1; they can be fixed by deleting your manifest and syncing again.

## 0.3.0 (2020-01-31)
* Rewrote texture packing routine with a new library, [Packos](https://crates.io/crates/packos).
	* This should fix textures overlapping eachother when running Tarmac with automatic spritesheets enabled.

## 0.2.0 (2020-01-21)
* Revamped configuration format.
* Added support for automatically packing spritesheets.
* Added support for nesting projects inside eachother via `include`.
* Added support for grabbing inputs by glob pattern.

## 0.1.0 (2020-01-03)
* Initial release.
